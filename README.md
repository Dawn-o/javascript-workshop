# JavaScript Workshop 🚀

Welcome to my **JavaScript Workshop**! This repository showcases various small projects I've created while learning JavaScript, using **Tailwind CSS** for styling. While the projects are simple and to the point, they focus on core JavaScript concepts to help solidify my understanding of the language.

You can view and interact with the projects live here:  
👉 [**JavaScript Workshop - GitHub Pages**](https://dawn-o.github.io/javascript-workshop)

## 💻 Technologies

- **JavaScript**: The core scripting language for functionality.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for minimal, utility-first styling across all projects.

## ⚠️ Note

Currently, none of the projects are fully responsive, so they might not display properly on smaller screens or mobile devices. I'll be improving the responsiveness as I continue to refine and build upon these projects.

## 📂 How to Explore

1. Visit the [GitHub Pages link](https://dawn-o.github.io/javascript-workshop) to try out the projects live.
2. Alternatively, clone the repository:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dawn-o/javascript-workshop.git
   ```
3. Browse the project folders and open any index.html file in your browser.

## 🚧 Ongoing Journey
This repository is a work in progress, and I’ll be adding more JavaScript mini-projects as I continue learning. Each project serves as a practice and stepping stone in mastering JavaScript. Check back regularly for updates!
