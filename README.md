# JavaScript Workshop 🚀

Welcome to my **JavaScript Workshop**, a collection of small but powerful projects created as part of my journey to master JavaScript. Each project in this repository focuses on building foundational skills while exploring various features of JavaScript. With **Tailwind CSS** powering the UI, the projects are cleanly designed yet minimalistic.

These mini-projects are a testament to learning by doing, and you can explore them directly through the live demo link below.

## What You’ll Find 🌟

This repository features a range of small projects—like calculators and weather apps—that demonstrate core JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation, API requests, event handling, and more. All of these projects are styled using **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a consistent and streamlined look.

> **Note**: These projects are not yet responsive, so they may not display well on mobile devices. I’ll be working to improve this as part of the ongoing development.

## Tech Stack 🧑‍💻

- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language behind the functionality of each project.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used to quickly style the UI elements.
